- compiling the entire project, multi file: 
        1. using command: tsc --init //to create the tsconfig.json
        2. using command: tsc // to compile all file .ts in project
        3. using command: tsc -w or --watch // to using auto watching mode

        1.Uncommnet  "strict": true,                                      /* Enable all strict type-checking options. */
    // "noImplicitAny": true,                            /* Enable error reporting for expressions and declarations with an implied 'any' type. */
    // "strictNullChecks": true,                         /* When type checking, take into account 'null' and 'undefined'. */
